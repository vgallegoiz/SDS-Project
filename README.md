## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

Make sure you are in an environment with Python 3 and have administrative (sudo) access. The following steps describe how to set up the environment:

Create and activate the virtual environment

    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

Install Python dependencies

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Run the preparation scripts

    chmod +x ./start/start_requirements.sh
    ./start/start_requirements.sh

Install Snort

    sudo apt-get install snort -y

During Snort installation, make sure to correctly specify:

    Network interface: ens33

    Subnet: 10.0.0.0/16
